Hey, Welcome to my amazon clone backend server.

This is a backend server for Amazon-Clone-Client(https://github.com/HenockAdane/Amazon-Clone-Client.git).

About:
This is an express server which allows http and https requests from the client side for things such as user sign in, user sign up, user confirmation, user payments and products from a mongoDB database using mongoose.

During the build:
During the build, I learnt how to structure my code more cleanly and efficently so that myself and others who read my code can understand what is going on without much effort. I done this by impelementing the MVC (model view control) pattern. I also learnt what express.Router and async await is and how to use it. All this allowed me to understand and use patterns and modules that I did not understand before.
